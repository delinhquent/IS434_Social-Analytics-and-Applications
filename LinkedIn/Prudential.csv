It is highly readable and is a great introduction for people who need to understand the preliminaries of estate planning. For this reason, Andrew set out to write a simple book. It is sometimes difficult to do this as you have to bring across ideas to the reader in fewer words to capture his attention. Andrew has also been very candid about his own family situation and how he wants to plan for the care of his family members and his parents. His desire and compassion to help others is also evident in the several pages of the book. Finally, I believe readers will take away key concepts that are essential for their estate planning and I would recommend someone like Andrew to help you in that process.  16-May-2016  https://www.facebook.com/Makingyourlastwishescometrue/";"Singapore";"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Wealth%20Coach%20LLP";;;;"Rockwills Corporation Pte Ltd (199704239Z)";"ROCKWILLS ESTATE PLANNER (REP)";"Mar 2014";"PRESENT";"Our current Professional Will-Writing Services have expanded from traditional Professional Will-Writing to cover a range of related services with the aim of achieving the fulfillment of our motto ""Making Your Wishes Come True""";"10 Anson Road  #06-17 International Plaza  Singapore 079903";"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Rockwills%20Corporation%20Pte%20Ltd%20(199704239Z)";;;;"Prudential Assurance Company Singapore";"Prudential Financial Services Director";"Mar 2014";"PRESENT";"www.prudential.com.sg/FC-info";"Singapore";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/prudential-assurance-company-singapore";"prudential-assurance-company-singapore";;;"Raffles Provident LLP";"Managing Partner, Private Client & Risk Management";"Apr 2013";"PRESENT";"At Raffle Provident, we believe in providing the Singapore Best Advisory work in General Insurance with integrity by putting YOUR interest before us.

Why? Cause he needed work experience and why limit where that experience is from?  When he got back, he secured a role in trade documentation where he was exposed to the commodity trading world. He made the transition into a Jr. Trader within the year and began to make a name for himself not as the best trader but instead a trustworthy business partner.   It was at this juncture did he saw the value of people and relationship. It was the foundation he used when he helped put together a Joint Venture with one of his then employers.   His key focus on people and his in-depth understanding of business provided him a unique platform to perform while working the international markets being based in Singapore and subsequently Malaysia.   Playing to his strength, he made a transition into the financial services sector not as an SME with business acumen but instead a relationship guy who sees the value of investing in people and what that translates to. This took him to the uncharted waters of the HR world as a People Business Partner. He built in-depth understanding of the insurance business and provided consultative HR support that was tailored and relatable to everyone from C-suite to the entry level employee looking to start their career.

Guiding them to decide what's important to them and what to ""buy""​ and what to do.   Most people of influence use the right people to help them in deciding. This is akin to relationship of a Managing Director and its's Financial Controller,  I believe.  Furthermore, time is a scarce commodity.  Why read up when there is one you may trusts to help you in decision?
